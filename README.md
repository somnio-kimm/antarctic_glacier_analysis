# ❄️ Antarctic Glacier Analysis

To develop a deep learning model that predicts future Antarctic glacier distributions by learning from historical satellite time series images.

## 🔍 Overview

This project builds and evaluates a deep learning-based forecasting system to predict monthly Antarctic glacier coverage using historical satellite image time series.
It explores various temporal models including ConvLSTM2D, Transformer, AutoEncoder, and GAN-based architectures. The pipeline also integrates visualization tools and a lightweight web application for result interaction.

🗓️ Project Period: April 28, 2025 – May 16, 2025
